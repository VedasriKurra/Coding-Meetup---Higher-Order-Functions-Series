Question:
Coding Meetup #15 - Higher-Order Functions Series - Find the odd names

You will be given an array of objects representing data about developers who have signed up to attend the next coding meetup that you are organising.

Given the following input array:

var list1 = [
  { firstName: 'Aba', lastName: 'N.', country: 'Ghana', continent: 'Africa', age: 21, language: 'Python' },
  { firstName: 'Abb', lastName: 'O.', country: 'Israel', continent: 'Asia', age: 39, language: 'Java' }
];
write a function that when executed as findOddNames(list1) returns only the developers where if you add the ASCII representation of all characters in their first names, the result will be an odd number:

[
  { firstName: 'Abb', lastName: 'O.', country: 'Israel', continent: 'Asia', age: 39, language: 'Java' }
]

def find_odd_names(lst):
    def is_odd_sum(name):
        return sum(ord(char) for char in name) % 2 != 0

    return [i for i in lst if is_odd_sum(i['firstName'])]
